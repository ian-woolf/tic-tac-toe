# tic-tac-toe
Simple javascript tic-tac-toe implementation

Inspired by the blog post [here](https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/06/08/how-an-interview-code-submission-that-wasnt-even-submitted-changed-our-process/), which talks about an interview problem defined as:

```
Instructions:
1. Fork this repo on GitHub
2. Create a program that can interactively play the game of Tic-Tac-Toe against a human player and never lose.
3. Commit early and often, with good messages.
4. Push your code back to GitHub and send us a pull request.
We are a [REDACTED*] shop, but it is not a requirement that you implement your program using that tech stack.
```

## Usage

To execute some example behaviour:
```
node index.js
```
I may allow the behaviour to be configured via the command line or a config file at some point.

To run tests:
```
npm test
```
